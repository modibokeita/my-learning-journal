                <h3>Blog four</h3>
                <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                I've made the big jump over 
                to the Bootcamp to get expert code 
                reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet 
                like-minded peers.</p>
            </article>
            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
            <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>

                <h3>Blog five</h3>
                <p>Learning React has completely transformed the way I build user interfaces. 
               From components and hooks to props and state, I'm now creating dynamic web applications with confidence and clarity.</p>

                <h3>Blog six</h3>
                <p>Exploring UI/UX design has taught me how visual hierarchy and usability directly affect user experience. 
               I'm learning to combine design tools and user-centered principles to build interfaces that are both functional and beautiful.</p>

                <p>My full-stack journey has begun! I’m now connecting front-end skills with backend technologies, 
               building complete applications using tools like Node.js, databases, and RESTful APIs.</p>
